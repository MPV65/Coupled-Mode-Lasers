LOG NOTES:

Files for the coupled mode model for two laser cavities.

Files in this folder:

m files:

	compareCoupled1D.m
	coupled1D.m
	coupled1DS.m
	loadParams.m
    runCoupled1D.m
	singleInt.m
	SolveCoupled1D.m
	SolveCoupled1DP.m

MAT files:

    EWK.mat
	higher.mat
	PRA.mat
	strong.mat

Need to check units for parameters and put these in help files.

Still need to look at and re-document 

	compareCoupled1D.m
	SolveCoupled1D.m
	SolveCoupled1DP.m

Then need to find some test parameters for a script file.

Would be good to add in some boundary tracing programs.
