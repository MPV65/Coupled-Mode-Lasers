Implementing fixed step RK routine for Gaussian noise

Notes:

opt = 0;            % Do NOT plot graphs, do NOT zero out noise 
opt = 1;            % DO plot graphs, do not zero out noise
opt = 2;            % Do NOT plot graphs, DO zero out noise
opt = 3;            % DO plot graphs, DO zero out noise        

(1) 
    (i)     Copied pulse_asym_noise.m to pulse_asym_noise_dt.m
    (ii)    Copied gaussianNoise.m to gaussianNoise_dt.m
    (iii)   Edited script so calls to gaussianNoise are now to gaussianNoise_dt
    (iv)    Ran script (opt = 0), saved graph as 'gaussian_noise_dt_test1.fig'
    (v)     Ran script (opt = 2), saved graph as 'gaussian_noise_dt_test2.fig'

(2) 
    (i)     Added in code for RK4 - at present uses DT calculated in old routine
    (ii)    Ran with existing step size - solution NaN!
    (iii)   Tried a step size of 0.001 - got an indexing error
    (iv)    Set up routine so that it calls variable step correctly when dt = 0

Debugging:

Using dt = 0.001

Index exceeds the number of array elements (50000).

Error in gaussianNoise_dt/asymPairGauss (line 533)
        GA = abs(xiA(index));

Npt = 50000

Fixed by limiting index to length of array

(2)
    (v)     RK version now runs OK without noise but results differ from variable step

Previous steps were carried out using Ian's test numbers.

Here, I am reverting to the original numbers I used.
