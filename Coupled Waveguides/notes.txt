Interface notes:

Configure the waveguide(s)

-1-D pair (triple as a future option not yet used ?)

-Specify the core/clad indecies, k0, width, spacing etc (all within interface code)

-Compute the nearest neighbour coupling (using existing 1-d routine)

-On return have an option to overwrite all of these basic guide values

-Set up the time domain

- pulse vary all parameters

-Option noise, & its amplitude – let’s use the gaussian routine as you have already done it & add a 0-1 noise amplitude factor, set to zero there is no noise, to 1 it’s the full gaussian amplitude. I can then look at the RIN and scale the amplitude to get this about right. If we do this a different way in the future we could just add a new noise routine ?

-Option – turn on to DC only - Bias, length of simulation, time step, graphing options all as now really

-Option- DC + pulse, - all as now is fine, with all optical plots as now

-during the pulse I’d probably like to be able to change more that just the bias, so for example I’d probably like to be able to change the coupling (etaA, etaB), or the frequency offset, or the offset phase to explore what happens. I am not sure as things stand if it would return all of these to their pre-pulse values at the end of the pulse period ?

-Print simulation conditions

-Single page with just a list of the values actually used during the simulation, I currently do this by trying to take a screen shot of the command window along with the graphs but it would be much better in there was a simple list. To help keep track of things could we use a date/time stamp for the simulations and put this on the variable list & all the graphs then we can cross reference ? I don’t know how easy this is so shout if its difficult and I’ll manage ?
